Thanks for installing Buck!

In this quickstart project, the file apps/myapp/BUCK defines the build rules. 

At this point, you should move into the project directory and try running:

    buck build //apps/myapp:app

or:

    buck build app

See .buckconfig for a full list of aliases.

If you have an Android device connected to your computer, you can also try:

    buck install app

This information is located in the file README.md if you need to access it
later.
